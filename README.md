During the development of this HoPE 2024/2025 project, I developed an ambitious and new project together with other members of the “Mr. Nimbus Electromagnetic Accelerator” group. Our goal is to create a linear electromagnetic accelerator or “coilgun” by exploiting the creation of a magnetic field inside electrified solenoids. This project unites and excites everyone as it involves branches of physics that are still unknown to us third and fourth year high school students. It was precisely the difficulty of the project that pushed us to realize it, so already in the first weeks of HoPE, after having studied the topic of electromagnetism in depth with extracurricular courses, we designed a first sketch of this project. It involved the electrification of solenoids which results in the formation of a magnetic field inside them, which can be used to attract ferromagnetic objects. Our goal throughout this project has always been to accelerate objects in non-traditional ways, and I believe this is the best project, among those proposed, to do that.
